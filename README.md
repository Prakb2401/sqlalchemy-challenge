### SQLAlchemy Challenge

## General Information
In this challenge I used a sqlite file to track create queries using SQLAlchemy. I was able to use both my SQL knowlwedge as well as my Python/Pandas knowledge. I started off by setting up my engine to connect to SQLAlchemy and then began to use Python and Pandas to create queries to answer questions. I then made two visualization about the date presented. Finally I created a Python Flask API by using the app.py file. In this Flask API I created 5 links all answering different queries.
